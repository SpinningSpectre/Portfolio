    PongName: "Pong",
    PongChapter1: "V1",
    PongText1: "\"Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis\"\n but I'm sure everyone knows that. One of the great qualities of this is that Pong is one of the easiest games to make. That is why Pong was the first project I ever made at school. The project only lasted a few weeks so there wasnt a lot of time to make the project better.",
    PongText2: "Since I was new to programming I really avoided coding a bit for Pong. Most of the V1 code is made by school or by classmates. I mostly focussed on the art and left the programming for the second project we had: the Tank Game. Although I wasn't focussing on it, I did get to know the basics of unity with this project.",

    PongChapter2: "V2",
    PongText3: "Almost 250 days after the full completion of Pong I started to work on V2. V2 was finished in around 150 days and included a full code rework, redone art (as seen in the image) and it finally added options. Although the update didnt add much in gameplay I do really like what it did add in gameplay.",
    PongText4: "The update allowed you to customize most things in the game. These settings allow the game to still be fun even if its basic. Playing with less pedal speed can really make the game a challenge and playing with a snail ball that goes twice as fast every time it hits something can be fun. There is also an option to add more balls into the game, allowing up to 10 pong balls in a game at once which can very quickly get chaotic.",
    PongText5: "A main part of the update was the complete art rework. I don't think any V1 art still exists in V2. The art was remade to be consistant in size, and to just look smoother. This update also added particles to the game, making it feel more responsive if you score or if the ball bounces. It also added the ball waiting for a few seconds before moving at the start or on a score. A \"Christmas\" setting was also added, which changes all the art to be Christmas themed.",

    //Tank
    TankName: "Tank Game",
    TankText1: "The tank game is a single device 2d pvp game in which you shoot at the enemies with different types of bullets. The different types of bullets do different amounts of damage and move different. The game also has a boss mode, where you and the other person face a boss that does attacks based on its health.",
    TankText2: "This was my second school project. Since Pong was full focus on art I made sure this one was focussed on code. The game is decently small and was made 5 weeks so it does not have a lot of content, but I do want to expand on it at some point. Boss mode was added after I finished all the requirements for the game.",

    //Race
    RaceName: "Race Game",
    RaceText1: "The race game is a pve racing game with multiple powerups and upgrades. It has an upgrades shop and a few achievements with skins. The upgrades are bought with coins, which you get after finishing the race or by using powerups. There are built in \"dev tools\" which the player can turn on with the press of a button, basically giving the player cheats if they know the buttons. The players progress also saves.",
    RaceText2: "I was not very interested in the racing part of the race game, so I focused on just about everything else. I made a shop for upgrades, added achievements, skins, settings and the list goes on and on. I made sure all the players progress was saved by using playerprefs so they could play again later. The race game was the 3rd school project and had double the time as Pong or the Tank Game.",

    //MineSweeper
    MineName: "MineSweeper",
    MineText1: "Minesweeper Remade is a small recreation of the classic Minesweeper that was made in 2 days. It does not guarantee a big area at the start of the game and was only made because me and a classmate were not allowed to play minesweeper during lessons unless we were making it. Their minesweeper is linked on the itch.io page.",

    //Code Armada: Crash Guardians
    CodeName: "Code Armada: Crash Guardians",
    CodeText1: "Code Armada: Crash Guardians is an endless tower defence game where you protect your CPU from enemies such as water, fire and electricity. You can do this by placing 3 different types of towers or a trap around the map. There are 2 different motherboards (maps) for you to choose from. Every 10 waves there will be a boss enemy: A stronger version of a normal enemy.",
    CodeText2: "Code Armada: Crash Guardians was the first school group project and we had twice as much time for it as the race game. We were a group of 6, but one of our teammembers quit the school at the start of this project. Although they quit they did come up with the main idea for the game. Most of the code was written by me and NiekMSoftware. Development video ->",
    CodeText3: "The main systems I personally worked on are: The wave spawning system and the tower attacking system. The tower attacking system is sadly not the best and often misses. I did however make sure that even if a bullet misses it still deals damage. The wave spawning system spawns small random groups of enemies. The amount of enemies increases per wave and different types of enemies also spawn later on, and become more common up to a certain amount the more waves the player completes.",

    //Virus Runner
    VirusName: "Virus Runner",
    VirusText1: "Virus Runner was a school game jam game. We had 5 days to make it and had a team of 6. Our team name was \"Team I'll be a bit later\" and as you could have probably guessed: A lot of our team was either later or not there a few days. I was mostly on the art of the game so I only did a few small amount of code. The theme was \"To infinity and beyond\". That is why the game is an endless runner.",

    //Lighten Up!
    LightenName: "Lighten Up!",
    LightenText1: "Lighten Up! is a global game jam game with the theme of \"Make me laugh\". You are the only happy monkey left in a town of sad monkeys. Laugh at them to make them feel better. You have 3 different laughs: A consistent single shot, an area laugh and a fast shot with a big cooldown because it hurts your voice. Once you make all the monkeys laugh you will get sent to a boss fight with a gorilla. After you make the gorilla laugh you win.",
    LightenText2: "This game was made in 2 days with a team of 7. Because this was a global game jam we were allowed to work on it 24/7, unlike the school game jams. Personally I still went home at the end of the days to sleep on my own bed and would return the next day to work on the game more. Due to us having such a big team one big struggle we had was well teamwork and just who was working on what. We also had the issue of going for a story game during a game jam. This is a bad idea since it is basically impossible to get everything you want done in a game jam.",

    //StoryFixer
    StoryName: "StoryFixer",
    StoryText1: "StoryFixer was a school game jam game. The jam was 5 days long and it's theme was \"Once upon a time\". The game has the player going through different stories to fix some problems. There are 3 different stories with their own goals and gameplay. This game ended up winning the \"Fits in theme\" category.",
    StoryText2: "The game was made with a group of 5, consisting of 3 first years and 2 second years. I mainly recorded the sounds in the games. This includes both sound effects and the music. I also coded in the dialoge system and most of the settings.",

    RealText1: "Real Time is an RTS (Real Time Strategy) in which you make your own army, base and attack other people. The game supports multiplayer but also allows you to fight an AI. There are 2 types of resources that you need to collect to build buildings and spawn people.",
    RealText2: "Real Time was made as a school project with a group of 5 people. We were allowed to pick the group ourselves. We had half a school year for this project with grading in the middle and at the end. We really struggled making the multiplayer in the game and due to this the game is lacking in other areas. This was mainly due to only one of us knowing how multiplayer works and the many struggles that come with that. I personally mainly worked on the building in the game and some other small things.",

You have to switch gears and watch the health of your tires while you are driving. If your wheels break while driving you will get a huge debuff. You can fix your wheels in the pitstop.",
    ZTTText2: "ZTT was made for a teacher during a Deep Dive at school. We had 1 school week to make the game and the only requirements we had was to make it a racing game. This game was made with a group of 5 people. Personally I worked on controller/wheel support and wheel breaking/varients.",

    PongText1: "\"Pong is een twee-dimentionale sport spel dat tafel tennis simuleerd.\"\n maar ik denk dat iedereen dat wel weet. Een van de beste dingen aan Pong is dat het makkelijk is om na te maken. Dit is waarom Pong het eerste project dat ik gemaakt had op school. Het project duurde een paar weken dus was er niet veel tijd om het beter te maken.",
    PongText2: "Aangezien ik nieuw was bij programmeren probeerde ik weg te blijven van code schrijven. Daardoor is het meeste van de code geschreven door leraren of klasgenoten. Ik liet het programmeren voor de Tank Game en het meeste van mijn tijd ging dus naar het visuele deel van de game. Ookal keek ik er niet naar leerde ik wel veel van de basics van unity met dit project.",

    PongChapter2: "V2",
    PongText3: "Bijna 250 dagen nadat Pong v1 helemaal klaar was begon ik met V2. V2 was klaar in ongeveer 150 dagen en had alle code helemaal herschreven, alle art hertekend en eindelijk opties gemaakt. Ookal had de update niet veel nieuwe dingen in de game gezet had het wel de game in betere plek gezet.",
    PongText4: "Deze update liet de speler veel dingen kiezen. Pedalen slomer maken kan de game moeilijker maken en een bal dat twee keer zo snel word als het iets raakt is ook leuk. Er is ook een optie om meer pong ballen in een keer te hebben (Maximaal 10) en dat wordt snel chaos.",
    PongText5: "Een groot deel van de update was dat alle pixel art opnieuw was gemaakt. Geen van de V1 pixel art zit nog in V2. Het was opnieuw gemaakt zodat het allemaal dezelfde groote heeft en zodat het er gewoon beter uit ziet. In deze update zitten ook particles, waardoor de een punt scoren het meer waard voelt. Er zat ook bij dat de bal een paar seconden wacht aan het begin en nadat er een punt was gekomen. Er was ook een \"Kerst\" optie bij gekomen wat alle pixel art een kerst thema geeft.",

    TankText1: "De Tank Game is een 2D pvp game dat je op een device speelt waarbij je op de andere speler schiet met verschillende soorten kogels.

    TankText2: "Dit was mijn tweede project op school. Aangezien Pong helemaal op pixel art in ging zat ik bij dit project meer in op de code.

Er zijn built in \"Dev tools\" waarbij de speler een soort cheats heeft, als de optie aan staat. De spelers progressie wordt ook opgeslagen, waardoor de speler later terug kan komen.",
    RaceText2: "Ik vond het race gedeelte van de race game niet heel interessant en daardoor maakte ik veel wat niks met het racen te maken: Een shop, achievements, skins, opties en nog meer.

We waren met een groep van 6 maar een persoon van onze groep ging van de opleiding af. Ookal was dat persoon gestopt met de opleiding heeft hij wel het idee voor het spel verzonnen. Het meeste van de code was gemaakt door mij en NiekMSoftware.",

Ookal had ik moeite met de kogels van de torens accuraat te maken doen ze wel altijd damage, ookal raken ze soms niet.
